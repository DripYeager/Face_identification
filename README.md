# OpenCV Machine Learning Project

The OpenCV machine learning project aimed to develop a model to detect and classify images with both eyes visible in them. The project involved several steps, including data collection, image sorting, and model training.



## Features

- Data collection using the Fatkun image downloader browser extension.
- Image sorting using Haar Cascade files for eye detection, obtained from the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/anaustinbeing/haar-cascade-files.git.
- Model training using wavelet transform and OpenCV in Python.
- Model accuracy of 88 percent.
